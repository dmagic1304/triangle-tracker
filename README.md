## Description

_This project will make a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle, or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility:

Equilateral: all sides are equal.
* Isosceles: exactly 2 sides are equal.
* Scalene: no sides are equal.
* NOT a triangle: the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.

In your code, make sure to use the following:
* pausing on exceptions and breakpoints to debug
* event listeners with function declarations
